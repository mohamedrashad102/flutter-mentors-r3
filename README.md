## What I Built

I created a comprehensive Coffee Order Management System in Flutter that demonstrates my understanding and application of Object-Oriented Programming principles, SOLID design principles, and various design patterns. This project showcases how I can build clean, maintainable, and extensible software architecture.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure I Created

I organized my project with a clear separation of concerns:

```
üìÅ My Project Structure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ models/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ coffee_types/        # Coffee entities I created
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ services/                # Business logic I implemented
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ factories/               # Factory pattern I applied
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ mappers/                 # Data transformation I created
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÅ reports/                 # Reporting system I developed
```

## ‚òï Coffee System I Implemented

### Abstract Coffee Class
I created an abstract `Coffee` class that serves as the base for all coffee types:
- Used **inheritance** by making all coffee types extend this base class
- Applied **encapsulation** by making properties final and read-only
- Implemented **Equatable** for proper object comparison

### Coffee Types I Created
I implemented 6 different coffee types, each extending the abstract Coffee class:
- **Espresso**: Strong and bold coffee shot ‚òï
- **Cappuccino**: Espresso with steamed milk foam ü•õ
- **Latte**: Espresso with smooth steamed milk ü§ç
- **Americano**: Espresso diluted with hot water üñ§
- **Mocha**: Espresso with chocolate and milk üç´
- **Turkish Coffee**: Traditional unfiltered coffee ‚òï

Each coffee type I created demonstrates **polymorphism** - they can all be treated as Coffee objects while maintaining their unique properties.

## üîß SOLID Principles I Applied

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) - What I Implemented
I ensured each class has only one reason to change:
- **Order class**: I made it responsible only for order data management
- **CoffeeFactory**: I created it to handle only coffee object creation
- **OrdersReport**: I designed it to handle only reporting and analytics
- **OrderMapper**: I built it to manage only data transformation between objects and maps

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP) - How I Applied It
I designed my system to be open for extension but closed for modification:
- **Adding new coffee types**: I can extend the Coffee class without modifying existing code
- **New services**: I can implement the OrderServices interface without changing existing implementations

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) - My Implementation
I ensured that derived classes can substitute their base classes:
- Any coffee type I created can replace the abstract Coffee class
- Any service implementation I built can substitute another OrderServices implementation

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) - What I Created
I created focused interfaces that don't force unnecessary dependencies:
- **OrderServices interface**: I designed it with only the methods needed for order management
- No client is forced to implement methods they don't use

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) - How I Applied It
I made high-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions:
- **LocalOrderServices**: I injected SharedPreferences as a dependency
- **OrderMapper**: I used CoffeeFactory abstraction instead of direct instantiation

## üé® Design Patterns I Implemented

### 1. Factory Pattern - What I Created
I implemented a `CoffeeFactory` class that centralizes coffee object creation:
```dart
class CoffeeFactory {
  Coffee create(CoffeeType type) {
    return switch (type) {
      CoffeeType.espresso => Espresso(),
      CoffeeType.latte => Latte(),
      // ... other coffee types I created
    };
  }
}
```
**Why I used it**: To encapsulate object creation logic and make adding new coffee types easier.

### 2. Strategy Pattern - My Implementation
I created an abstract `OrderServices` class with two different implementations:
- **LocalOrderServices**: I implemented this to store orders in local storage using SharedPreferences
- **MemoryOrderServices**: I created this for in-memory storage during development/testing

**Why I chose this pattern**: To allow switching between different data storage strategies at runtime.

### 3. Template Method Pattern - How I Applied It
I implemented a common `prepareOrder()` method in both service classes that follows the same validation steps:
- Check for duplicate orders
- Validate order status
- Normalize customer data

**My reasoning**: To ensure consistent order validation across different storage implementations.

### 4. Mapper Pattern - What I Built
I created an `OrderMapper` class to handle data transformation:
```dart
class OrderMapper {
  static Map<String, dynamic> toMap(Order order) { /* My implementation */ }
  static Order fromMap(Map<String, dynamic> map) { /* My implementation */ }
}
```
**Purpose**: To separate data transformation logic from business logic.

## üìä Order Management System I Built

### Order Model I Designed
I created an immutable `Order` class with:
- Private fields with public getters (**encapsulation**)
- A `copyWith()` method for immutable updates (**builder pattern**)
- Proper equality comparison using Equatable

### Order Services I Implemented
I built two different service implementations:

**LocalOrderServices** - What I created:
- Persists orders to device storage using SharedPreferences
- Implements proper error handling for duplicate orders
- Uses OrderMapper for data serialization/deserialization

**MemoryOrderServices** - My implementation:
- Stores orders in memory for testing and development
- Implements the same interface but with different storage mechanism
- Demonstrates the flexibility of my strategy pattern implementation

## üìà Reporting System I Developed

I created an `OrdersReport` class that provides comprehensive analytics:
- **Total orders tracking**: I implemented methods to count total, pending, and completed orders
- **Popular coffee analysis**: I built functionality to find the most ordered coffee type
- **Statistics calculation**: I created methods to calculate percentages and order statistics
- **Performance metrics**: I implemented completion rate tracking

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Decisions I Made

### State Management Preparation
I designed my models to be compatible with state management solutions:
- Used immutable objects with `copyWith()` methods
- Implemented proper equality comparison
- Created clear separation between data and presentation layers

### Type Safety I Ensured
I prioritized type safety throughout my implementation:
- Used enums for `CoffeeType` and `OrderStatus`
- Implemented null safety properly
- Created strong typing for all data structures

### Testing-Friendly Architecture I Built
I designed my code to be easily testable:
- Used dependency injection in services
- Created interface-based design for easy mocking
- Separated pure functions from side effects

## üîÑ How My System Works

Here's how I designed the data flow:

1. **Coffee Creation**: I use my CoffeeFactory to create coffee objects based on type
2. **Order Management**: I create Order objects with proper validation
3. **Data Persistence**: I use my strategy pattern to save orders (LocalOrderServices or MemoryOrderServices)
4. **Data Retrieval**: I fetch orders using the same service interface
5. **Analytics**: I generate reports and statistics using my OrdersReport class
6. **Data Transformation**: I use OrderMapper to convert between objects and serialized data

## üéØ What I Accomplished

Through this project, I demonstrated my ability to:

‚úÖ **Apply OOP Principles**: I successfully used encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction
‚úÖ **Implement SOLID Principles**: I applied all five SOLID principles with practical examples
‚úÖ **Use Design Patterns**: I implemented Factory, Strategy, Template Method, Builder, and Mapper patterns
‚úÖ **Create Clean Architecture**: I built a system with proper separation of concerns
‚úÖ **Write Maintainable Code**: I created code that's easy to extend and modify
‚úÖ **Design for Testability**: I built interfaces and used dependency injection for easy testing

## üöÄ Future Extensions I Can Add

My architecture makes it easy to extend:
- **New coffee types**: Simply extend the Coffee class and update the factory
- **Additional storage options**: Implement OrderServices for database or cloud storage
- **More analytics**: Add new methods to OrdersReport class
- **Enhanced validation**: Extend the prepareOrder template method

## üåü Conclusion

This project represents my practical application of software engineering principles, showcasing my ability to write clean, maintainable, and extensible Flutter applications.
