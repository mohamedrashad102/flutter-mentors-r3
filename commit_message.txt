refactor(auth): Refactor auth flow and add home screen

- Refactor the authentication flow by moving the `BlocListener` from the form widgets to the view widgets. This centralizes the logic for handling UI events like navigation and showing snackbars.
- Add the home screen and navigate to it after a successful login.
- Pass the email to the `RegisterSuccess` state to be used in the verification screen.
- Display API-provided error messages for the OTP field in the email verification form.
- Add a link to the registration page from the login page.
